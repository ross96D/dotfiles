**Order by priority? (obtained from fish autocompletion)**.
My intent is to describe the standar of config files without reading some technical rfc or warever.

1. directory for user config `~/.config`
2. directory for system-wide config `/etc/`
3. user-specified directory for third-party vendor `~/.local/share`
4. directory for third-party software vendors `/usr/share/`
